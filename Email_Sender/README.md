# Email Sender

This program is developed in python and can send automated emails to the receiver's email address.

So before using the program right away, you will have to change the values of the variables on line 95 and 97 as your email address and password (don't worry, we cannot hack you as your email info is stored in the program itself, nowhere else). 

You will also have to lower security for your gmail account.
It is suggested and recommended that you make a separate gmail account to use this program.

It has to be kept in mind that only gmail accounts work with this program and also that if the program closes after you press the button it doesn't mean that your email has been sent.

Also, before anyone wonders what is the use of this email sender, I also don't know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

To install the required modules, you will have to open the terminal in the working directory where you have cloned the repository,

Then you will have to type,
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Then after changing the variable values, you can run the program without any hassle.
