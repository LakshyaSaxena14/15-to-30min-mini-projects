Additional Modules required:
1. PySide2

This program can send automated emails to the receiver's email address.

So before using the program right away, you will have to change the values of the variables on line 95 and 97 as your email address and password (dont worry we cannot hack you. It is out of bounds for the developer in this context). You will also have to lower security for your gmail account.
It is suggested and recommended that you make a separate gmail account to use this program.

It has to be kept in mind that only gmail accounts work with this program and also that if the program closes after you press the button it doesn't mean that your email has been sent.

Also, before anyone wonders what is the use of this email sender, I also dont know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
